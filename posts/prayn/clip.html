            <h2>Exploring spatial representations in Visual Foundation Models</h2>
            <p>
                Recent publications studying the inner workings of foundation models have focused largely on 
                internal representations of large <i>language</i> models (LLMs). In this short blog post, I will explore neural
                 representations in large <i>vision</i> models
                (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Radford et al.</a>, 
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oquab et al.</a>, 
                <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/segment-anything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirillov et al.</a>)
                with the aim to adress a specific question: Can we find spatially selective cells that encode parts of the visual field, 
                akin to the ones found in biological neural networks?
            </p>
            <p>
                For this I first create a dataset that can be used to estimate receptive fields among synthetic neurons (<a href="#design-section" class="internal-link">'design'</a>).
                We then record neuronal responses across many different artificial layers (<a href="#record-section" class="internal-link">'record'</a>) and visualize and quantify 
                the responses using methods traditionally employed in neuroscience (<a href="#analyse-section" class="internal-link">'analyse'</a>). Finally, we establish 
                an 'artificial-causality' by virtually lesioning a subset of spatially selective neurons (<a href="#perturb-section" class="internal-link">'perturb'</a>). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Each of the aforementioned steps — design, record, analyse, perturb — mirrors techniques used in 
                neuroscience, with artificial neural networks (ANNs) simplifying at least two (record & perturb) of these procedures dramatically.
                This simplification is made possible by the fact that, in contrast to biological tissues,
                we have direct access to every single neuron and its connections,
                enabling an investigation with an unprecedented level of detail.
            </p>

            <h3 id="design-section">Design</h3>     
            <p>
                We first create a dataset containing 3000 stimuli which are randomly 
                distributed across the visual field. Initially, I had the stimuli take 
                several geometric forms — square, circle, triangle, rectangle — which were randomly 
                picked during dataset creation. I ultimately decided against the added complexity of different shapes
                and used only circles, which are randomly sampled to 
                have a diameter between 20 and 80 pixels and are positioned to cover the full visual field.

                With these stimuli at hand, we can characterize the responses of neurons within a vision
                model with respect to each location in the visual field. The model I will be using here is based 
                on the original CLIP publication of OpenAI, more specifically we will use the <a href="https://github.com/openai/CLIP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ViT-B/32</a> 
                architecture<span class="footnote">[I]<span class="footnote-content">These models are trained using a contrastive objective, given pairs of 
                    images and text. During training, the loss is minimized to make sure that 
                    each image in the embedding space is close to its paired text. To quantify performance during inference,
                    people usually measure the similarity between the image and each of the text embeddings using cosine similarity 
                    with the most similar text being the best match.</span></span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                To explore whether CLIP can accurately identify the above-created stimuli, 
                we first need to generate text embeddings to compare with the visual embeddings of these stimuli. 
                Initially, I used three texts: a circle, a square and a triangle.
                The correct response for all stimuli would 
                be "a circle", which CLIP gets right 88% of the time (see Table below). 
                However, the introduction of another descriptor ("an empty image") complicates the outcome.
                The performance for "a circle" drops to 
                9% while the performance for "an empty image" reaches 90%. 
                This shift suggests that, rather than recognizing the shape, 
                CLIP reclassifies the stimuli as resembling an empty image.
            </p>
            <p>
                Initially, I was struggling with this problem for a while as I naively 
                thought it to be trivial for CLIP to actually classify the circle 
                correctly. After some experiments with other texts, I noticed that providing additional color information is 
                sufficient to have CLIP recognize the correct shape.
                When using "a black circle" instead of "a circle" the classification performance
                goes back up to 73%. This reveals how adding seemingly simple details to descriptors
                can play a pivotal role in enhancing the model's ability to correctly identify visual elements.

                Having established that CLIP is capable of "seeing" the circle with 
                consistent accuracy we can proceed with the second step: recording 
                neural responses. For this we integrate hooks across all model layers, which enables the capturing and storing
                of responses across various stimuli for subsequent analysis. 
                In general, hooks are functions that are triggered after a specified event;
                here they are triggered during the forward pass and store the layer activations<span class="footnote">[I]<span class="footnote-content">
                Note that hooks can be also triggered during the backward pass, e.g. to <a href="https://medium.com/the-dl/how-to-use-pytorch-hooks-5041d777f904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clip the gradients</a></span></span>:
            </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def _register_hook(layer, layer_name, activations):
    """
    Register a forward hook to record the layer's activations.

    """
    def hook(module, input, output):
        activations[layer_name] = output.detach()
    return hook</code></pre>
            <p>
                Note that the "recording" phase starkly contrasts with traditional neuroscience 
                experiments, where single-cell recordings still demand a tremendous 
                amount of effort. This typically involves skilled 
                experimentalists doing meticulous work, which encompasses 
                surgeries, implant placements, management of electrophysiological or 
                calcium imaging devices, and numerous other complex tasks. 
                In contrast, ANNs provide us a more efficient pathway: directly accessing
                and analyzing neural responses, bypassing the invasive procedures inherent to 
                biological studies and allowing for a more detailed exploration of the synthetic 
                networks' internal processes.

            <h3 id="analyse-section">Analyse</h3>
            <p>
                There are several methods to visualize neuronal responses from a trained neural network, e.g. 
                by visualizing the filters or activation maps of convolutional layers or by adapting the input 
                to maximally excite a given neuron within a specific model layer. Here, I will visualize the neuron activation
                with respect to the spatial location of each stimulus, i.e. a ratemap of the activity of each neuron
                shown in the image reference frame. As there are millions of parameters within CLIP, I only visualize responses
                for the vision transformer (63 million parameters) and focus in particular on 
                the attention layers of specific residual blocks<span class="footnote">[I]<span class="footnote-content">More 
                    specifically I use layer \(visual.transformer.resblocks.[L].attn\) for each residual block 
                    \(L\), with \( L ∈ {0, 1,...,11} \).
                </span></span>. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                Each residual block contains 50x768 parameters, where the first dimension indicates the number of patches (7x7)
                plus the 'cls' token. In CLIP the 'cls' token is prepended to the sequence of image patches, then processed normally
                to gather global image information, which is then extracted at the end as the main representation of the entire
                image<span class="footnote">[I]<span class="footnote-content">To understand the intricacies of the vision transformer
                it was helpful for me to look more closely at the code,
                especially where the class embedding is <a href="https://github.com/openai/CLIP/blob/a1d071733d7111c9c014f024669f959182114e33/clip/model.py#L214" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initialized</a>

                Below, I plot the ratemaps of the 'cls' token across all 12 residual layers, highlighting the top 5 neurons for 
                three different scores, which are commonly used in neuroscience to quantify spatially selective cells. The spatial information score 
                quantifies how well the firing rate of a cell predicts the animal's 
                location in space, essentially indicating the amount of spatial information that the neuron's activity conveys.
                The grid score quantifies the degree to which firing fields of a neuron form a periodic grid-like pattern, 
                akin to grid cells found in the entorhinal cortex<span class="footnote">[I]<span class="footnote-content">I use the grid score here as my initial hypothesis was to find
                    visual grid cells which encode locations within the image reference frame.</span></span>. 
                The border score is used to measure the tendency of a neuron to fire selectively near the boundaries
                of the environment, resembling the function of border cells that provide a sense of environmental borders.

                    For each layer, the ratemaps show the neurons with the highest scores with respect to the spatial
                    information criteria, the grid score and the border score. When toggling the random weights box
                    all responses are based on a randomly initialized CLIP model, using the initialization schema from the
                    original paper.

            <p>
            As shown above, we can see that spatially selective cells persist even in deeper network layers, which implies 
            that information about the position in screen coordinates is directly encoded in the activity of these neurons.
            I originally anticipated these deeper layers to show an
            invariance of the neurons to an object in screen coordinates, as seen in hippocampal structures where 
            cells (mostly) fire with respect to world coordinates. A more careful examination of these responses 
            and their distribution across the model layers will be discussed in a future blog post.

            <h3 id="perturb-section">Perturb</h3>
            <p>
                Finally, we can assess whether perturbing the layers and the above described
                 spatially selective cells will change 
                the model's performance. For this, I first systematically lesion every layer by setting the weights to zero. 
                In this case we use all layers within each residual block for both the visual and the language transformer, not 
                just the attention layer as in the ratemaps above. Here, I again quantify 
                performance based on the model classifying the input stimuli as "a black 
                circle" or "an empty image".

                    <strong>Performance of model across lesioned layers.</strong>
                    Every layer within the model is lesioned by replacing the weights with 0. The performance 
                    is then quantified with the lesioned model before restoring the model weights. Note that the information flow is not zeroed out completely, due to the 
                    skip connections within the residual blocks.

                As seen in the plot above, performance varies widely between between different layers.
                Lesioning certain layers appears to have a more pronounced effect on the model's ability 
                to classify the stimuli accurately, especially when lesioning visual layers around "Resblock 9" the model 
                struggles to detect any circle within the image. Lesioning or disrupting the first convolutional layer also
                has a pronounced effect, suggesting that this layer is essential for capturing basic features and patterns
                from the input, which are critical for subsequent layers to build upon and make accurate classifications.
                Conversely, some layers, when lesioned, show minimal disruption in performance ("Resblock 11"),
                suggesting their contributions might be redundant or less critical for this specific task. 
            </p>
        
            <p>
                To find out if the neurons that we identified as encoding information about visual space 
                also play a causal role in stimulus classification, we can make targeted lesions instead of lesioning layers indiscriminately.
                From the 
                lesioning of the layers above, we can infer that the "best lesion" (in the sense 
                that it resulted in the worst performance) occurred at Layer 9. With a targeted lesion, 
                we aim to use fewer neurons to achieve the same performance. For this I implemented individual lesions 
                for every single stimulus. To perform individual lesions, we first obtain ratemaps for each neuron, calculated across all stimuli. 
                We then lesion the neurons which have the highest activity at the central location of the stimulus,
                and do this across every stimulus in our dataset.

                The targeted lesion shows that the above described spatially selective neurons seem to have a causal influence 
                on the performance of the model, e.g. when lesioning cells that have a high activity in the lower left part of the image
                in visual space, the model is unable to detect stimuli with a circle in the lower left part of the image. 
                Note that the performance deficit is smaller than one might have suspected, 
                likely due to neurons having multiple fields of high activity instead of a single bump (see ratemaps above in layer 9).

            In this post I explored the inner representations of one of the most widely used 
            vision models (CLIP) and show that there are spatially selective cells which 
            are causally linked to the performance of the model. I hope to address some of the open questions 
            in a future post, where I will be exploring some of
            the following research questions<span class="footnote">[I]<span class="footnote-content">
                Your suggestions or additional questions are very welcome.
                Please feel free to discuss it <a href="https://github.com/CYHSM/cyhsm.github.io/issues">here</a>.</span></span>:

            <ul class="box-list">
                <li>Why do ratemaps from an untrained model often show border-like responses?</li>
                <li>How does spatial selectivity arise during model training?</li>
                <li>How are grid scores & border scores distributed across model layers?</li>
                <li>Can we find targeted lesions which further drop the performance of the model compared to the ratemap based lesions from above?</li>
                <li>Can we use targeted lesions to introduce or remove biases from the model?</li>
